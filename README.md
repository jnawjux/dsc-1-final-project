### Challenge Problem:
- Using King County housing sales statistics, can you make an effective model to help predict home prices? 

### Our Approach:
- In this project we focused on using the CRISP-DM approach with the data we had available and created our final model with the best available features created from our data. We focused on the mindset of creating this simplified model for a startup looking to get into housing price prediction.
